I. INTRODUCTION 
Various Army electronic systems may be exposed to nuclear explosion 

effects in a tactical battlefield. Included among these nuclear effects 
is the nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP), which is a transient broad-
band electromagnetic field capable of damaging or upsetting electronic 
equipment. To predict the signature of the EMP generated by a nuclear 

burst, it is necessary to determine the physical parameters that induce 
the DIP. These parameters, called D4P drivers, are time and space 
varying ionization and Compton electron currents in the nuclear radia


tion field around the burst. Once the ionization and the currents are 
specified, it is usually possible to solve some form of Maxwell's equations 
for the EMP generated. This report summarizes the development of 
a software package specifying EMP drivers produced by neutrons emitted 
from a near-surface burst in the air. The package was designed for use

with the NEMP computer code used at the Harry Diamond Laboratories 

(HDL). A separate report summarizes the development of a similar 
software package for EIP drivers due to prompt gamma radiation. 

2. MOTIVATION 
The EMP drivers are due to one component arising from prompt gamma 
radiation and a second component arising from neutron radiation. The 
neutron component includes elastic recoil ionization (frequently called 
"heating") by air constituent nuclei and also includes effects of 
secondary gamma radiation produced by a number of neutron capture and 
inelastic collision reactions in the air and the ground. The development 
of DIP drivers by secondary gamma rays is physically similar to the 
development for prompt gamma radiation, although the magnitude, the 
direction, and the time dependence are markedly different. 


Maxwell's equations for DIP from a near-surface burst are solved by 
3

the NEMP computer code. 2 The NEMP code requires E4P drivers to be 
specified in a volume extending to several kilometers from the burst 
point and for times extending to many milliseconds after the instant of 
burst. The EMP drivers must be incorporated into the code as smooth 
fits to results of quasi-analytic or Monte Carlo predictions. The NEMP

code in many respects is an extension of the LEMP computer code4 for EMP 
from surface bursts, which was initially developed from about 1966 to 
about 1969. The EMP drivers in the earlier LEMP code could have been 
modified and used in the NEMP code with certain limitations. These 
limitations are discussed briefly, and reasons are given for the impor


tance of the new results reported here. 

In this study, the neutron-induced I4P drivers are divided into five 
categories% (1) neutron elastic (recoil) ionization, (2) fast neutron 
air inelastic collision (n,n'y) drivers (both Compton electron currents 

and ionization), (3) fast neutron ground inelastic collision (n,n'y) and 
capture (n,y) drivers, (4) thermal neutron ground capture (n,y) drivers, 


and (5) thermal neutron air capture (n,y) drivers. Of these, one would 
expect the NEMP geometry to introduce complications to LEMP code 
prescriptions for categories (1), (2), and (4), since the proximity of 

the ground is different. Category (5) was not treated originally by the 
LI4P code. Category (3) would be quite different for the NEP code and 
probably of reduced magnitude. However, the cross sections for most of 
the above reactions have been subjected to concentrated study and revision 
with the advent of the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF-B, 
distributed Brookhaven National Laboratory, Brookhaven, NY). It is 

likely that new neutron transport studies based on recent ENDF-B cross 
sections would produce results different from those upon which the La4P 
code neutron-induced ZMP drivers were based. Further, by omission of 
the thermal neutron air capture (n,y) drivers, the LEMP drivers were 
limited to times less than about I ms after the burst. 

The LEMP authors 5 developed a newer and much more complete prescription 
of categories (1) through (5) based on results of Sargis and 
others. 6 Factors weighing against the use of these prescriptions in the 
NEMP code include the following: First, a newer revision (Round 3) of 
ENDF-B was released in 1973. Second, the only burst heights considered 
by Sargis were 0, 200, and 500 m, whereas the NEMP code operates princi


pally at tactical burst heights between 0 and 200 m. Third, the new 
LEMP EMP driver curve fits were considered by this writer to neglect 
certain important ground-air interface effects such as time-dependent 

depletion and enhancement. Fourth, the transport results6 were based on

"energy grouped" cross sections, whereas a "Point" cross-section treatment 
should be more accurate at deep penetrations. Fifth, a single 
typical source neutron energy spectrum was used in the LEMP drivers, 

* 
with a parameter available for adjusting the concentration of high-
energy (14-NeV) neutrons; a more desirable package would allow flexible 
representation of arbitrary source neutron energy spectra. 


For these reasons, new Ibnte Carlo transport calculations have been 
done to describe more accurately the neutron-induced DIP drivers. 7 The 
extent of these calculations is sxauarized in table 1. Edited results 
of these calculations were transmitted to this writer on computer magne

3. APPROACH 
The edited results of Monte Carlo calculations contain statistical 
fluctuations inherent in the Monte Carlo method. The NE4P code demands 
smooth prescriptions of the EKP drivers to obtain useful results. One 

may attempt to fit smooth general functions (such as polynomials) to the 

Monte Carlo results by a least-squares fitting technique, for example, 

or one may attempt to fit the Monte Carlo results with certain appro


priate smooth functional forms. By using a polynomial of sufficiently 
high degree, the former technique may allow the Monte Carlo results to 
be fitted more faithfully than the latter, but the closer fit may mean 

that the "noise" is being fitted instead of the underlying smooth "true 
answer." The same difficulty can arise by using the latter technique if 


too many degrees of freedom are permitted. On the other hand, if the 
polynomial degree is not high enough, the fit may be a poor 

representation of the true answer. In general, however, using 


appropriate smooth functional forms will involve far fewer degrees of 
freedom than using general functions if the functional forms are well 
chosen and if the fit is a global fit over the entire space-time volume 
of interest rather than a piecewise fit over many smaller subdivisions 
of the space-time volume. 

The strength of the technique of using well-chosen functional forms 
is that physical variables usually do behave according to relatively 

simple physical principles that are approximately described by rela


tively simple functional forms. A global fit of properly chosen functional 
forms to Monte Carlo results could reduce the error below the 
statistical error of the Monte Carlo calculation. The fitting algorithm 
should heavily weight low-variance results over high-variance results to 
reduce the error. 

The new edited Monte Carlo results for neutron-induced E4P drivers 
consist of three physical quantities (energy deposition and radial and 
polar components of Compton electron current) defined for 19 time intervals 
within 63 spatial volume detectors, for five categories of reaction 

(recoil, air inelastic, etc.), four burst heights, and nine source 

neutron energy bands (table 1). There are 646,380 quantities to be 
fitted. Apparently, the fitting algorithm must be highly automated to 
allow useful results to be obtained with a realistic investment of human 
effort. 


4. CURVE-FITTING PROCEDURE 
Thirteen distinct functions describe the time and space dependence 

of 13 EMP drivers: 


.f 8 


(1) Ionization in the air from neutron elastic collisions and 
charged particle production (such as (n,p) and (n,a) reactions that 
deposit kinetic energy locally) 


(2) Radial Compton electron current in the air (measured in the 
polar coordinate system centered at the burst) due to high-energy neutron 
reactions in the air (neutron energy more than 0.1 MeV) 
(3) Polar Compton electron current in the air for the same as (2) 
(4) Ionization in the air for the same as (2) 
(5) Radial Compton electron current in the air due to low-energy 
neutron reactions in the air (neutron energy less than 0.1 MeV) 


(6) Polar Compton electron current in the air for the same as (5) 
(7) Ionization in the air for the same as (5) 
(8) Radial Compton electron current in the air (measured in the 
polar coordinate system centered on the ground beneath the burst) due to 
high-energy neutron reactions in the ground 


(9) Polar Compton electron current in the air for the same as (8) 
(10) Ionization in the air for the same as (8) 
(11) Radial Compton electron current in the air due to low-energy 
neutron reactions in the ground 
(12) Polar Compton electron current in the air for the same as (11) 
(13) Ionization in the air for the same as (11) 
Drivers (2), (3), and (4) are due principally to high-energy inelastic 
collisions with atmospheric nitrogen. Drivers (5), (6), and (7)are 
due to thermal capture by atmospheric nitrogen. Drivers (8), (9), and 

(10) are due to inelastic collisions with the ground and fast neutron 
capture by the ground. Drivers (11), (12), and (13) are due to thermal 
neutron capture by the ground. 
A mathematical notation is used to simplify the succeeding discussion. 
The vector functional F represents the drivers. F is dependent 
on time (t) and space (x,y,z). Subscript d running from I to 13 denotes 

which of the drivers is represented: 


Fd(t,x,YZ) 

9 



Time t is the local time, retarded by the speed of light from the 
coordinate center. 

The functional Fd is a functional form incorporating a certain 
number, nd, of parameters p. This is written as 

Fd(t~xYzPdi) ' 

where Pdi' i = I to nd, is interpreted as the parameter vector of length 
nd for driver d. In general, nd is not the same for different d, but is 
approximately 10 in this report. 

Parameters Pdi are evidently dependent on the energy of the source 

neutrons producing the drivers and on the height of burst. Other variables 
are ignored, such as variations in water content of the air and the 


ground and variations in ground composition. The parameters may then be 

written 


pdi ( j,h) 

or 


,

Pdij(h) 


where j denotes the ordinal of the source neutron discrete energy band 
and h is the height of burst. In this way, p is a discrete function of 

the source neutron energy (band) and a continuous function of the height 
of burst. It thus appears that the DIP driver fits 


Fd(txoY,';Pdij) 


are defined when parameters Pdij are evaluated for a specific height of 
burst, 

Pdij = Pdij(h) 

The total number of functions Pdij(h) to be determined is 

13 nd 9 13 nd 

d-1 i-1 j-1 d= i=1 


Since nd -10, this total is roughly 1100. Thus, there are over a 
thousand such functions to be specified. Determination of this many 
functions was a formidable undertaking and required considerable 

computer time (about 40 hr on an IBM System/370 Model 168). 


10

*functional 

The following strategy was adopted: 

a. Through previous experience supported by trial and error, 13 
functional forms were constructed to constitute driver functionals Fd These 
were functions of time and space and were based on a certain 
number, nd, of parameters. 
b. Monte Carlo predictions for the 13 drivers were available as 
functions of time for each of 63 spatial volume detectors around the 
burst for each combination of four burst heights and nine source neutron 
energy bands. For a particular source neutron energy band, each driver 
was fitted to the time and space dependence of the Monte 
Carlo data, for each of the four sets of data corresponding to the four 
heights of burst (1, 50, 100, and 200 m). The fit was obtained through 
an optimization process by adjustment of each of the nd parameters for 

the driver. 


c. Four values , Pdij(hk), k = 1 to 4, were thus derived for 
each parameter pdij corresponding to the four heights of burst. These 
four values were approximated by simple functions of the height of 
burst. In some cases, a constant function was used; in other cases, a 
rational fraction was used. Certain constraints were imposed on the 

rational fraction to insure satisfactory behavior of the approximation. 


d. Since parameter functions Pd ij(h) only approximated values 
Pdij(hk), k -I to 4, it was desirable to readjust the amplitudes of 
the driver functionals Fd(t,x,y,z;pdi (h)) to obtain a closer fit to the 
Monte Carlo data. Since the amplitude was by choice one of the parameters--
specifically, pd, " this readjustment involved simply reoptimizing 
the fit to the Monte Carlo data by adjustment of this one parameter, 
Pd1"j Once this adjustment was done for each of the four heights 
of burst, amplitude parameter function Pdlj(h) was refitted to these 

four improved values for Pdlj(hk). 


ea This completed the definition of all parameter functions 


Pdij(h) for a particular neutron energy band, j. Process b to d was 
repeated for each of the nine energy bands. 

This strategy was implemented through the use of two specially 
developed computer codes, BIGFIT and HOBFIT. BIGFIT performs a global 
minimization (that is, simultaneously over all volume detectors and time 
bins) of an error function estimating the "badness of fit" of driver 
functionals Fd to the Monte Carlo data. HOBFIT approximates the burst 
height dependence of parameter values Pdij(hk) with either a constant 

function or a rational function. BIGFIT performs the minimization for 
specified parameters of the functional% In practice, the specified 
parameters ware usually either the amplitude parameter only or all 
parameters of the functional.

The curve-fitting procedure is illustrated in figure 1. This procedure 
was performed for each source neutron energy band and each driver 
functional, or 9 x 13 -117 times, except where the driver was exactly 
zero for an energy band. (For example, no high-energy neutron reactions 
can occur for a low-energy source neutron.) First, starting with trial 
guesses for the parameter values, BIGFIT was run four times (once for 

each burst height) to fit the driver 
functional to the Monte Carlo data 


for that case. All parameters were * * -.m 
adjusted to obtain the fit. The G E 
functional parameter values so de-WI 
termined were stored in temporary 
data file FITFILE. Second, HOBFIT 

obtained functions approximating the -U 
burst height dependence of the 
parameters stored on FITFILE, saving 
these functions on permanent data 

file HOBFILE A. Third, the param---mmiMu 
eter functions were evaluated at the ' ., 
four burst heights, and the resulting 
parameter values were used as 
BIGFIT was rerun four times (once 
for each burst height) to fit the m-

5. MINIMIZATION OF FIT ERROR 
The goal of the curve-fitting procedure in this work is to obtain a 


global fit to the Monte Carlo data for the EMP drivers-that is, to fit 
a single functional to the data over the entire space-time grid of 
volume detectors and time bins. The global fit is desired rather than a 

12 



piecewise fit to the space or time dependence of the data. For a global 

fit, a penalty function is constructed that measures the suitably 


weighted error or the disagreement between the data and the curve fit. 

The curve fit is improved by reducing the magnitude of the penalty 
function by adjustment of the fit parameters. A best fit is obtained 
when the penalty function arrives at a (minimum) extremum. The penalty 
function is a function of the several parameters for the driver functional 
and, with suitable smoothness, is amenable to minimization by 

standard optimization algorithms. 


To illustrate the curve-fitting procedure, a specific example of a 
driver functional is examined. Neglecting air density and mass-scaling 

effects for simplicity of presentation, the functional for ionization by 
high-energy neutron inelastic collisions in the atmosphere (that is, 
"air inelastic" gamma ray production) is 

I(x,y,z,t) = p1ACD 


where 


x,y,z = Cartesian coordinates of the observer measured from the 
coordinate center on the ground beneath the burst, 

t = retarded time at the point (x,y,z'), 

zA = z -h,

This particular driver functional is relatively simple and incorporates 
range attenuation factor D, tim dependence factor C, and ground 
depletion factor A. These factors are typical of other driver func


tionals, as well, although other functionals may also include time-
dependent or range-dependent ground depletion (or enhancement) 
factors. Different time-dependence factors are used also.

In this functional, eight parameters are used so that the penalty 
function is a function of eight variables. The penalty function is 
defined as function P of parameter vector p k = 1 to 8:

and variance V is proportional to the square of a fractional deviation 
averaging about 20 percent for the data given.

It is apparent that minimization of P(pk ) yields a weighted least


squares fit. The use of the inverse of variance Vi. increases the 

weight of low-variance Monte Carlo data, which is expected to be more 

accurate than high-variance data in inverse proportion to the 

variance. The use of ratio f~j/f~j causes the relative importance of 

this driver to be considered in comparison with all the other 

contributing drivers. If the ratio is small, the weight is diminished 

accordingly; if the ratio is near unity (that is, no other driver is 

contributing significantly), the weight is maximized. User-defined 


factor is used to force the best fit to be obtained near the ground 

(large 
wwi 
i) and a moderately good fit far from the ground (small wi). A 
very good fit near the ground is desired because most EMP targets (that 
is, electronic systems) are found on or near the ground.

over detector volume and time bin (tj_1,t-, a numerical integration

Vi 

must be done. This numerical integration must be done efficiently 
because integral f must be evaluated 63 x 19 -1197 times for each 
evaluation of penalty function P. Penalty function P must typically be 
evaluated several hundred times to locate a useful minimum and the 
associated best fit. Thus, the numerical integration may be required 
about 105 times to complete one of the necessary 4 x 13 x 9 -468 runs 
of BIGFIT. This is about 107 integral evaluations for the entire fit


3

ting problem. Evaluation of functional F requires roughly 10-s of 
computer central processor (CP) time, so that about 104 N seconds of CP 
time are forecast if N evaluations of functional F are needed to obtain 
its numerical integral f. Clearly, N must be as near unity as possible 
to avoid prohibitive computer time requirements. Accordingly, a three-

point Gauss-Legendre quadrature was used for the time integration, and a 
special, highly accurate two-point Gaussian quadrature (with adjustable 
weight function) was developed by this writer and used for the volume 
integration. Appendix A describes the two-point scheme. Several other 

techniques were used to reduce the overall CP time requirement to about 

40 hr for the entire curve-fitting project. 


With the penalty function thus defined for the driver functional, it 

is necessary to minimize the. penalty function by adjustment of the 
parameter vector. A highly efficient minimization algorithm is desired, 
in the sense of using the fewest possible evaluations of the penalty 
function. A number of different minimization algorithms were tested. 

15 


L. , .... I .I 

The most efficient algorithm for this application was determined to be a 


modified conjugate gradient method. This writer adapted the well-known 


conjugate gradient method8 to use finite differences to estimate the 


gradient matrix and to cycle indefinitely during a single descent proce


dure instead of repeating the descent procedure after cycling once for 

each element in the vector of independent variables. A very efficient 

algorithm with quadratic convergence also was developed to search for a 


minimum along a chosen direction, in connection with the descent proced


ure. Appendix B contains a listing of the FORTRAN version of these 


descent algorithms. It was found that minimization of the penalty 


function proceeded much more rapidly if amplitude parameter Pl were 


optimized analytically during evaluation of penalty function P(pkO 


Optimum amplitude a (to minimize P(pk) with respect to the amplitude 

parameter) can easily be shown to be trial amplitude at multiplied by

f( ) = the corresponding value of the fit using a nonzero trial 
value (completely arbitrary) for pl 


gij = corresponding complete weight function Wij/Vij used in 
penalty function P(pk). 

When p is chosen in this way to be a = Kat and when the minimization of 


P(pk) Is done for the other Pk exclusive of pl, the minimization process 
is greatly accelerated. 


Minimizing the penalty function (that is, obtaining the best fit) 
can be interpreted geometrically as finding the bottom of a hypersurface 
whose dimensionality is the number of functional parameters. An initial 
guess for the Pk provides a starting point for the descent. Taking an 
initial guess that is close to the true bottom reduces the descent 
a "fort and help, keep the descent path out of undesirable local minima 
that are far from the true bottom (that is, the least minimum). 
Although the computer calculation was performed in double precision, it

was learned that a minimum in the hypersurface takes on a rough, 
granular texture in its shallowest portions due to roundoff errors in 
the calculation. This undesirable texture impedes the descent to the 
desired minimum. In general, the speed of descent is slowed by 
complexity or exceptional shallowness of the hypersurface. Greater 
complexity is typically caused by more parameters having higher polynomial 
degree than quadratic (in a Taylor expansion of the penalty 
function) so that the descent requires more changes in direction. 
Shallowness increases in rough proportion to the number of scattered 
data being fitted with the functional. For example, if the number of 
data is increased tenfold, but the data scatter (due to finite variance) 
is not reduced, the hypersurface becomes roughly 10 times shallower. It 
then becomes harder to find the precise bottom of the shallower 
surface. In this work, the penalty function hypersurface is both 
complex and shallow, and the success of the fitting process depended 
critically on the efficiency and the robustness of the minimization 
procedures. 

The initial guesses for the various sets of parameters pk were 
usually taken from the optimal values of Pk for adjacent source neutron 
energy bands or burst heights. After the optimum values for pk were 
obtained for a particular descent, the importance of each parameter was 
tested. If elimination of a parameter caused a sizeable increase in the 


penalty function, that parameter was deemed important. If a negligible 
increase was observed, that parameter was deemed unimportant and was 

removed from the functional. The functionals for several drivers were 
considerably simplified in this way. 


An example of the effect of minimizing the penalty function is shown 
for one volume detector in table 2. The energy deposition (or ionization) 
due to thermal neutron capture in the ground is given for volume 

detector 33, source neutron energy band 9 (8.19 to 15.0 MeV), and 200-m 
burst height. Detector 33 is 600 to 900 m above the ground at 1200-to 
1500-m ground range from the burst. Table 2 gives these parameters:

of the Monte Carlo score for this driver,

of tha Monte Carlo score for the sum of all drivers,

by optimal fit score f, 


eT, the percentage of difference between Monte Carlo score 
fij and trial fit score fT1 


eT, the same as e, but evaluated for the trial f it score 

fT" 


The goal of the fitting process is to make e as small as possible in 


each time bin. When r is larger, a better fit is needed to make e small 


and thereby make e small. Generally, e is desired to be roughly equal 


to or smaller than di. for each time bin. Since fractional deviation 

d. (due to the variance) is an estimate of the Monte Carlo error, 
diference e between the ffit and the Monte Carlo score should be about 
equal to d.. Thus, when d is large, e may be large; when dij is 
saerg 20 o 25 ercent Intcable 2, time bins 11 through 13 have 4ij 
averaging 20 to 25 percent and e averaging about 10 percent; time bins 
15 through IS have di. averaging 40 to 50 percent and e averaging about 
40 percent. The values for e and e appear to fluctuate approximately 
randomly about zero in time bins 8 through 19, as would be expected of a 
good fit to the data. The largest values for eT and e have been 
reduced by the fitting process to smaller values for e and e

6. BURST HEIGHT DEPENDENCE OF FIT PARAMETERS 
Having obtained parameter values at four burst heights, we desired 
to develop smooth functions of burst height to approximate the parameter 
evident in the burst height dependence. The

values. Some scatter was 
functions chosen should avoid reproducing the scatter, but capture the 

Two burst height functions were


important trend of the data. 


selected: (1) the constant function, independent of burst height, and 

(2) the rational function 
C2 h + C3h2 

C1 + 
g(h) = 2 
I + Ch 

where h is the burst height and Ci are fit coefficients. By inspection 
the author determined

of the parameter values at the four burst heights, 
which of the two burst height functions was appropriate for a 
parameter. Many parameters were clearly independent of burst height. 


Other parameters displayed such severe scatter that it was necessary to 
use merely an average value for all burst heights. on the other hand, 


many parameters showed well-defined trends and were fitted with rational 
functions. 


Fitting the four values of a parameter with a rational function was 
not a trivial problem. In its application to real EmP prediction 
problems, the rational function would be evaluated at other burst 

heights. Therefore, the behavior of the rational function must be 
carefully controlled for all possible burst heights. For example, 


simply fitting the four parameter values with rational function 9(h) 

would reproduce the data exactly, but might introduce poles, crossovers, 


and similar erratic behavior at other burst heights. To avoid this 
possibility, several strategems were adopted. First, the fit was to be 

done by use of Courant's well-known penalty function method for optimization 
with nonlinear constraints, and the nonlinear constraints would be 
defined so as to inhibit the erratic behavior. Second, the rational 


function would be made to fit not the four data, but the piecewise

linear function p interpolating the four data. 

The penalty function used was 

Q(Cir) . [gj) -+ r(I + N2 + N3) 

20 



The h. are about 40 burst heights on the interval from 1 to 300 m. 
NI, N2 , and N3 are positive semidefinite functions that are zero when a 

corresponding constraint is satisfied. In the optimization process, Q 


is minimized for successively larger values of r by using as each starting 
point the previous optimum values for Ci As r is increased to 
infinity, Q becomes optimal for the constraints represented by Ni, N2, 
and N3. The specific nonlinear constraints were these: 

a. For complex h, no poles of g(h) in the right half-plane of h, 
2


N,Nj = 
== 1 8[min(O,C4)]2 

b. No crossover to negative values of g(h) for large h, 
=N2108[min(O,C3)]2/,(200 m) 


c. No negative values for g(h) for small h, 
N3 = [min(o,cl)]2/;(200 m) 

The minimization of Q was done for each value of r by adjusting the four 
Ci. The descent algorithms described in section 5 were used. For burst 
heights above 200 m, most driver parameters tend toward limiting values 
not much different from the value at the 200-m burst height. An excep


tion is the amplitude parameter for a ground-induced source. This 


parameter should decay monotonically to zero as the burst height increases. 
For burst heights above 250 m, the three high-energy ground 
driver amplitudes are made to decay by a factor of two for each additional 
100 a. Similarly, the three low-energy ground driver amplitudes 
are made to decay by a factor of 1.2 to 4, depending on the source 
neutron energy, fcr each additional 100-m increase in burst height over 

250 m. 


7, COMPARISON WITH LIQUID AIR EXPERIMENT 

Sidhu et a1 9 measured neutron and secondary gamma ray transport 

through a liquid air sphere for a 14-MeV neutron source. Their 129.3-om 


sphere radius was equivalent to an atmospheric range of 850 a. They 
published (their fig. 7) for secondary gamma rays a value of about 1.3 x 

-


1010 cm2-rad (tissue)/source neutron for the 4wr 2 dose at 850-m equivalent 
range in air. The corresponding value for the NEMP code energy 

-

band 9 (8.19 to 15.0 NeV) high-energy air driver is 1.5 x 1010 cm2-rad 
(air). One rad in tissue and one rad in air differ by only about 1 
percent, so these gama doses differ by about 15 percent.

and Engineering, 66 (June 1978), 428-433.

The NDMP neutron dose in air cannot be compared easily with the 
measured neutron tissue dose because neutron kerma* factors are very 

energy dependent in the range from I to 14 MeV. The neutron energy 
spectrum at the 850-m observer for the NEMP driver is unavailable to 
allow a conversion fron neutron air dose to neutron tissue dose. 

Shown in figure 7 of Sidhu et a19 are results of TARTNP computercode calculations of the gamma tissue dose. The TARTNP code is a dis


crete ordinates radiation transport code used at the Lawrence Livermore 
2

Laboratories. The results show the 4ir dose to a 2800-m range. 

Differences between the NEMP driver and TARTNP results 


appear to be 


small (a few percent) from 850 to 2500 m. The NE4P code results are 

roughly 15 pecent lower at the 500-m range. 


8. 
COMPARISON WITH EARLIER APPROXIMATION FOR IONIZATION BY 14-MeV 
NEUTRONS 
Longley et a15 developed approximations for EMP drivers for use in 
their LDIP 2 surface burst EMP environment prediction code. They used 

Longmire's analytic first-scatter theory and many-scatter diffusion 
theory to describe 14-MeV neutron direct ionization through elastic 
scattering and (n,p) reactions. Comparison of their 14-MeV neutron 
driver with the corresponding NEMP driver (energy band 9, direct neutron 

ionization) showed rough agreement and some differences. For dose in 
air, the NE4P results exhibited a 10-percent longer attenuation length 
at all ranges and a roughly 50-percent greater amplitude (factoring out 
the range dependence). Because detailed reaction cross sections 

were 


not used for this LEMP 2 driver (per C. L. Longmire, Mission Research 
Corp.), some disagreement is expected. 

Since the LEMP 2 drivers are independent of the source neutron 
energy spectrum (except for 14-MeV neutrons), a comparison with the nine 
energy band NEMP drivers is a complicated undertaking beyond the scope 
of this report.

9 . SELECTED RESULTS 
Time histories of some NEMP neutron-induced E4P drivers are portrayed 
in figures 2 to 13. Radial Compton current, theta Compton 
current, and ionization rate are plotted. Results are shown for two 
observers 0 and 500 m above the ground for each of two burst heights of 
1 and 200 m. The ground range from the burst to the observer is 1000 

m. All results are for a source of one neutron in the energy band of 
8.19 to 15.0 MeV. Although drivers for other neutron energy bands have 
different amplitudes, attenuation lengths, burst height dependence, air-
ground interface effects, etc., these results are typical. 


In the figures, each driver is represented by a broken line with 


identifying symbols. The "F" denotes the high-energy ground driver 

(ground inelastics); the "I" denotes the high-energy air driver (air 
inelastics); the "G" denotes the low-energy ground driver (ground captures); 
the "A" denotes the low-energy air driver (air captures); and 

the "N" denotes neutron direct ionization including charged particle 
ionization. The total for all drivers is represented by a solid line 
with identifying "T" symbols. Each curve is the magnitude, or absolute 

value, of the driver or total. 


Several general observations can be made concerning burst height and 
observer height variations. High-energy ground drivers are signifi


cantly weaker for greater burst heights. Low-energy ground drivers 

decay more slowly with increasing burst height than do high-energy 
ground drivers because source neutrons penetrate to greater ranges while 


decaying to lower energies. Low-and high-energy air drivers and the 

neutron direct ionization driver all are roughly twice as strong for the 


200-m burst height as for the 1-m burst height because roughly half of 
the source neutrons are absorbed by the ground for the lower burst 

height. 


The drivers for theta Compton current are all stronger for observers 

closer to the ground surface because of the asymmetry presented by the 
air-ground interface. High-energy and low-energy air drivers for radial 
Compton current and ionization rate are relatively insensitive to 

observer height. The time dependence of the neutron direct ionization 

driver is different for the two observer heights considered. This 


driver is somewhat shorter in duration near the ground because many 

later-arriving multiply scattered neutrons tend to become trapped in the 


ground and do not ontribute to the driver in the air. The low-energy

ground driver for ionization rate is somewhat stronger for the higher 
observer, more noticeably so for the 200-m burst height than for the 1-m 
burst height. They differ because the secondary gamma rays (produced by 
neutron capture in the ground) that drive the ionization rate at the 
observer must penetrate more soil to reach the shallower observer. The 

low-energy ground driver for radial Compton current is even more 


strongly decreased for observers near the ground because the net Compton 
current flow follows the direction of the gamma ray flux, which is 
predominantly up out of or down into the ground (perpendicular to the 

radial direction). Higher off the ground, more gamma rays with a nearly 
radial direction arrive from ground regions close to the burst. 

All drivers contributing to the radial Compton current have the same 
sign (negative). The theta Compton current drivers may have different 
signs or even change sign. (By convention, positive is downward.) The 
theta Compton currents for high-energy ground and low-energy air drivers 

are positive and negative, respectively. The theta compton current for 

the low-energy ground driver is-generally negative at this range from 
the burst because of a secondary gamma ray "fountain" effect. This 
effect is due to many secondary gamma rays rising upward from the ground 


close to the burst and being turned down toward the ground after a few 
Compton collisions in the air. However, for observers close to the 
ground and close to the burst, enough upward-going secondary gamma rays 

are produced beneath the observer to reverse the theta Compton current 
from negative to positive for a period of time (fig. 9). The theta 
Compton current for high-energy air reactions was set identically to 
zero because it was about two orders of magnitude smaller than the 

corresponding radial Compton current and because the available Monte 


Carlo statistics for those data were so poor that a reliable fit was 

unlikely. 


The time history of the high-energy ground drivers for theta Compton 
current and ionization rate deserves some explanation. It may consist 


of two pulses: one from the initial arrival of neutrons at the ground 

beneath the burst and the other from the arrival of neutrons at an area 


roughly midway between the burst and the observer. The secondary gamma 
rays produced in the ground have an attenuation length considerably 
greater than the mean free path of the neutrons. This greater length 
causes contributions from reactions (per unit ground surface area) 
beneath the burst to be more important than contributions from reactions 
very near the observer. However, gamma rays originating in the ground 
closer to the observer are less attenuated by the ground because of 
their higher angle of departure from the ground. This complicated 

24 


-.---.--------



behavior was approximated by the two pulses mentioned. The approximation 
gives reasonable agreement with the Monte Carlo data, but too 
much importance should not be attached to the detailed structure of the 
time history approximation, expecially since the data time bins were 
one-third of an order of magnitude wide. The second pulse of this two-


pulse structure is not observed in the data (and the driver) for radial , 
Compton current. Also, the second pulse is not observed in the data 
(and the driver) for ionization rate if the burst height is very near 
the surface (fig. 4 and 7) or if the observer is very high (fig. 13).

The NEMP neutron-induced P driver package represents the state of 
the art onP allowing


for predicting drivers from near-surface bursts, 
flexible representation of any weapon's neutron energy spectrum end 
choice of any burst height in the near-surface regime. The package 
consists of separate space-and time-dependent drivers for radial end


theta Compton current and ionization rate, for high-and low-energy 

reactions in the air and the ground, for nine source neutron energy

bands, for any near-surface burst height. 

This report has described the develoment of this iPdriver package

for neutron-induced sources, for use in the NUI code for DIP environment 
prediction for near-surface nuclear bursts.* The development was 

based on the concept of obtaining a global fit of certain well-chosen

functionals to Monte Carlo transport data over the entire set of volume 
detectors and time bins. The global fit obtained in this manner offered 
several advantages over fitting with olynomials, including the 
effective elimination of Monte Carlo "noise" and the possibility of 


reduction of error below the level of Monte Carlo statistical error. 


The fit also involved far fewer degrees of freedom. The global fit was 

obtained by minimization of a penalty function representing the badness 

31 


~ J 


of fit. Because of the large amount of computer time involved, highly 
efficient minimization algorithms were employed. The difficulty of the 
minimization depended, among other things, on the variance of the Monte 

Carlo data, which averaged about 20 to 30 percent. The burst height 
dependence of the fit parameters was explicitly obtained for burst 
heights from I to 250 m. Extrapolation methods were devised for burst 
heights greater than 250 m. 

Comparison of ionization from gamma rays induced by a 14-MeV neutron 


source with experimental measurements gave good agreement. Comparison 

with the LD4P 2 direct neutron ionization driver for 14-MeV neutrons 
revealed significant differences. Typical results were discussed for 

two burst heights and two observer heights, for the 8.19-to 15.0-MeV 
source neutron energy band drivers.

APPENDIX A.--A TWO-POINT QUADRATURE SCHEE4 

Integrating a driver functional over the entire volume of a volume 

detector can be very time-consuming if unsophisticated quadrature 


methods are used. The volume detector concerned is a square toroid, 
that is, a toroid with a square cross section in coordinates (xz,#). 
The toroid is bounded by X ,XZ, and Z , where x is the ground range 
from the coordinate center an z is the height above the ground. The 
driver has azimuthal symmetry around the center of the toroid (x -0) so 

that an integration in independent variable + is trivial. Thus, an 

integral over detector volume 


J; L

I . f(x,z)(x 2 + z2) /2dx dz d# 
becomes 

I= 2w r2 fZ 2f(xz)(x2 + z2)1/2 dx dz 


If f(x,z) describes a driver functional, the salient spatial gradients 

of f(xz) are (1) in the vertical (z > 0) direction due to proximity of 

the ground and (2) in the radial direction from the burst due to 

geometric and atmospheric attenuation. A particularly accurate Gaussian 
quadrature rule would use the geometric and atmospheric attenuation as a 
weight function. 


Our goal is a Gaussian quadrature rule for the integral 


= v(x,z)w(x,z;a) dx dz , 

where v is a function of x and y and w is a weight function defined by 


w(x,z;a) = exp(-ar)/(I + r2) 

r -[x2 +(z -h)2 ]1 o 

The burst height is h. The advantage of this weight function rests on 

the fact that it represents the actual spatial dependence (for a 


suitable choice of a) better than a low-order power series would. 
Parameter a is essentially the atmospheric attenuation coefficient (the 

reciprocal of the attenuation length) and is available for use during

APPENDIX A 


the calculation of a driver integral. Thus, we may exploit our know


ledge of a to construct the quadrature based on weight function 
w(x,z;a). In computer program BIGFIT, we actually first construct a 
family of quadrature rules for a range of values ai. Then when a driver 
integral is being calculated, the mi nearest to a is determined, and its 

corresponding quadrature rule is used. In this way, the construction of 
the quadrature rules is kept out of the inner program loops. 


For the J integral quadrature rule, we seek quadrature points 

(xI z1) and (x1Iz ) vith weight coefficients w and w , respectively.

Thus, a unique quadrature rule (x1 .,z. ,z,w., and w2 ) was obtained 

for each combination of volume detector ana before commencing the 

descent algorithm to fit a driver functional to Monte Carlo data. Then 

during the descent, the numerical integration of K-like integrals 
proceeded extremely rapidly.
